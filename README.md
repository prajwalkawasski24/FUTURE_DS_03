# FUTURE_DS_03
🎓 College Course/Faculty Feedback Analysis

This project analyzes structured student feedback collected through Google Forms after attending a college course or session. It uses data science techniques to uncover key trends, highlight strengths and weaknesses, and recommend actionable improvements for future courses or instructors.

 📌 Project Objective

The goal is to turn quantitative survey responses into meaningful insights for decision-makers in academia. Using Python and data visualization tools, we analyze Likert-scale feedback to assess teaching quality, content delivery, course difficulty, and student support.

📈 Analysis Performed

✔️ Step-by-Step

1. **Import and clean data** from Google Forms (CSV)
2. **Visualize average ratings** per question
3. **Find strengths and weaknesses** using descriptive stats
4. **Correlation matrix** to explore inter-aspect relationships
5. **Optional**: Perform sentiment analysis if open-text feedback exists
6. **Recommend improvements** based on low-rated areas

📊 Key Visuals

- Bar charts of average ratings per feedback question
- Heatmap showing correlation between different aspects
- Highlight tables showing strong and weak points

💡 Example Insights

- Instructors are rated highly on subject knowledge and willingness to solve doubts.
- Students report that assignments are too difficult or not well-aligned with course content.
- Visual aids and course structure have a direct impact on whether students recommend the course.
